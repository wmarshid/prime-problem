This project was created for the Prime tables coding exercise provided by FindmyPast.

How to run
- To run the program navigate to this directory and run the following command;
'python prime_generator.py <num>'
Where num is the number of primes you wish to generate
For now it just returns what you enter into it (but this will change soon!)

- To run the test suite for the program navigate to this directory and run the following command;
'python prime_tests.py'
Your output should include each of the unit tests 

What I'm pleased with
-
- I observed that each row in the matrix adds up to the prime factor of that row multiplied by 10, so made sure to include this as a test condition. I noticed later however that this only works for the first three primes.

What I would like to improve on
