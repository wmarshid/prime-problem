This project was created for the Prime tables coding exercise provided by FindmyPast.

How to run
- To run the program navigate to this directory and run the following command;
'python prime_generator <params>'
Where params is the number of primes you wish to generate
For now it just returns what you enter into it (but this will change soon!)

- To run the test suite for the program navigate to this directory and run the following command;
'python prime_tests'
Your output should include each of the unit tests
